# Automated-High-Availability-Website-Deployment-on-AWS

Problem Statement: How to orchestrate a website with lesser time and higher
availability along with autoscaling.

Industry: Internet related

Topics: In this AWS project, you have to deploy a high-availability PHP application with
an external Amazon RDS database to Elastic Beanstalk. Running a DB instance external to
Elastic Beanstalk decouples the database from the lifecycle of your environment. This lets
you connect to the same database from multiple environments, swap one database for
another, or perform a blue/green deployment without affecting your database.

Highlights:
Launch a DB instance in Amazon RDS
Create an Elastic Beanstalk Environment
Configure Security Groups and Scaling
